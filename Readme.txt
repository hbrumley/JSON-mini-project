This is a mini-project to showcase my abilities to use JSON data in Pandas. The given dataset is about governmental projects.

First I have determined the 10 countries with the most projects, then the 10 most common project themes.

The dataset had some names missing in the list of themes, so I replaced the pandas data frame with one with the names filled in.
